##  Project Overview

This project is a complete implementation of **Ultimate Tic Tac Toe** in Python, featuring:

* A fully interactive **GUI** using `tkinter`.
* Multiple play modes:

  * Human vs Human
  * Human vs AI
  * AI vs AI
* AI with three difficulty levels:

  * **Easy**: Random move selection
  * **Medium**: Heuristic blocking and winning strategy
  * **Hard**: Minimax search with CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) techniques including:

    * Forward checking
    * Arc consistency (AC-3)
    * Alpha-beta pruning
    * MRV heuristic for variable selection

---

##  Game Rules (Ultimate Tic Tac Toe)

* The board consists of 9 smaller tic tac toe boards arranged in a 3x3 grid.
* Players take turns playing in the small boards.
* The twist: Your move determines the board your opponent must play in.
* Winning a small board claims it on the main board.
* Win the overall game by winning 3 small boards in a row on the big board.

---

##  AI Overview

* **Minimax with CSP**:

  * **Evaluation Function**: Assesses both small and big board progress, with special emphasis on center and corner control.
  * **Move Ordering**: Prioritizes center, corner, and edge moves.
  * **AC-3**: Ensures arc consistency between possible moves.
  * **Forward Checking**: Avoids assigning values that block future moves.
  * **MRV Heuristic**: Chooses variables with the smallest legal domain.
